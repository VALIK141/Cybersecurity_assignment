Firewalls provide protection against outside cyber attackers by shielding your computer or network from malicious or unnecessary network traffic. Firewalls can also prevent malicious software from accessing a computer or network via the internet.
The benefits of a firewall include:

    Protection against unauthorized access and cyber-attacks.
    Network traffic filtering to block malicious content.
    Prevention of data breaches and sensitive information leakage.
    Control over internet usage and access to specific resources.
